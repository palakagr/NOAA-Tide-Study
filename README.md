# NOAA-TideStudy
Final Project
MUSA 550

For my final project I will be using NOAA’s tide and current dataset. The data is available from 1920 to 2020 and is updated every few hours. Using this data, I will like to map the increase in sea levels along the east and west coast and also compare the two edges. 

The final project was inspired by Reuter’s research from 2014 - https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/waters-edge-the-crisis-of-rising-sea-levels/#gauges-interactive
 
The cities I wish to map are a part of the resilient by cities design proposals and the Rockefeller 100 resilient cities. The list is a start but not exhaustive. 
-	Greater Miami and the Beaches
-Washington, DC
- Seattle
-	San Francisco
-	Los Angeles
-	New Orleans
-	Cape May
-	Boston
-	New York
-	Philadelphia
-	Galveston Pier 21
-	Sewells Point
-	Atlantic City
